            Hello, I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at
            Miami University, where my academic journey is deeply rooted in the
            the ever-evolving field of Machine Learning and AI. My current research 
            endeavors revolve around multi-modal models and their security against adversarial
            attacks. Specifically, I am dedicated to fortifying the architecture and preventing jailbreak
            of large language models enabling strong resistance against adversarial examples. This pursuit is
            driven by my passion for contributing to the advancements in
            artificial intelligence and its responsible utilization in diverse
            technological landscapes.
